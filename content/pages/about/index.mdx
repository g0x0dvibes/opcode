Hi

I work in infosec, but I've been interested in hacking since I discovered 2600 and Phrack in the 90's. Times have changed and there is so much information available now. I owe so much of what I've learned from the resources online, to the free zines, and all the amazing books that are available. This is a place for me to share some of what I've learned, and hopefully help someone else.

The infosec industry is full of so called 'rock stars' and experts, and yes some of what we do is very difficult, and there truly are some geniuses. But I think more than anything, most of us have done a terrible job of explaining technology. We've been arrogant and unfriendly to people who ask questions, or seek help.

Hacking is about being curious, about being playful and about being interested in how things work. We make break things, we put things back together, and sometimes we reconfigure things to work differently than they were intended.

We are all one, we are stronger together, and there is enough for everyone.

This is my humble attempt at helping to teach a little. If you're just getting started, you can do this. If you're seeking information, you're doing great. Be curious, and realize that none of us knows everything. We are all enternal noobs.

And above all, don't forget to have fun. That's what it's all about.
